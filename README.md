# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Software engineer with an A.S. in Computer Science and currently pursuing a B.S. in Statistics & Data Science at UCSB, with a passion for **building and deploying impactful software**. 

I started my programming journey in **C++**, inspired by a love for **graphics programming**. Along the way, I built **games**, **physics engines**, **chess**, and more, which taught me the power of bringing ideas to life through code.  
This passion evolved into an interest in **productizing and deploying software**, leading me to explore **full-stack web development**.  

I made multiple failed projects: Automata Trading, Find Your Homie, Und3tectable, etc.
I ended up finding success building DormParty (acquired by Kupid Dating). Currently working on its predecessor, KupidTV. KupidTV is going to be the gen-Z way of streaming.
