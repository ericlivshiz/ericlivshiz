# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi there! Iâ€™m a software developer with an A.S. in Computer Science and currently pursuing a B.S. in Statistics & Data Science at UCSB, with a passion for **building and deploying impactful software**. 

I started my programming journey in **C++**, inspired by a love for **graphics programming**. Along the way, I built **games**, **physics engines**, **chess**, and more, which taught me the power of bringing ideas to life through code.  
This passion evolved into an interest in **productizing and deploying software**, leading me to explore **full-stack web development**.  

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On:
- **[Find Your Homie](https://find-your-homie.vercel.app/)**: A platform to help people connect and find shared housing.  
- **[Automata Trading](https://automata-trading.vercel.app/)**: A no-code platform for creating, backtesting, and sharing automated trading bots.  

ðŸ’¡ **Iâ€™m actively looking for contributors to both projects!** If youâ€™re interested, please message me.  

### ðŸŒŸ Open to Opportunities:
Iâ€™m currently seeking opportunities in the **job market sector** where I can apply my skills in **software engineering, web development, and data-driven solutions**. Letâ€™s build something great together!
